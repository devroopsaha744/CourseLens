He’s also the creator of widely-used open-source packages like BERTopic, PolyFuzz, and KeyBERT, which have millions of downloads and are utilized by data professionals globally. FAQ What are State Space Models (SSM) in machine learning? State Space Models (SSM) are used in machine learning to model and predict systems that evolve over time. They represent the system's state as a dynamic process, helping to capture temporal patterns in data, making them useful for tasks like time series forecasting, control systems, and natural language processing. How do State Space Models differ from traditional RNNs? State Space Models (SSM) and traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) both handle sequential data, but they differ in approach. SSMs use a mathematical framework to model the system's state and evolution over time explicitly. In contrast, RNNs use neural networks to implicitly learn patterns in sequences without explicitly modeling the system's state. What is the Mamba architecture in AI? Mamba is an alternative AI architecture designed to address the limitations of traditional transformers. It enhances efficiency with optimizations like RMSnorm and offers significant improvements in inference speed—up to 5× higher throughput. Mamba also scales linearly with sequence length, making it highly effective for handling real-world data, even with sequences up to a million tokens. As a versatile backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across various domains, including language, audio, and genomics. Notably, the Mamba-3B model outperforms transformers of the same size and rivals those twice its size in both pretraining and downstream evaluation. How does Mamba compare to transformer models? Mamba architecture differs from traditional transformer models by leveraging state-space models (SSMs) instead of the self-attention mechanism. This key difference allows Mamba to achieve linear complexity scaling with sequence length, a significant improvement over the quadratic scaling seen in transformers. While transformers excel in parallel processing with self-attention, Mamba's use of SSMs enables it to handle sequences more efficiently, especially in tasks involving long sequences, while still supporting parallel processing during training. What are the applications of State Space Models in NLP? State Space Models (SSM) are used in NLP for similar applications as other Language Models (LLMs), such as predicting and modeling sequential language patterns. However, SSMs stand out due to their ability to handle long text sequences more efficiently, making them particularly advantageous in tasks that involve processing extensive dependencies within the text. How do transformers work in large language models? Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to process input data in parallel, allowing large language models to efficiently learn relationships between words in a sequence, improving performance in tasks like translation and text generation. Why are RNNs considered in AI despite transformer popularity? RNNs are still used in AI because they excel at handling sequential data with strong temporal dependencies, and their simpler architecture can be advantageous in specific applications where transformers might be overkill. What are the benefits of using Mamba in deep learning? Mamba architecture offers improved efficiency in deep learning models, particularly in handling complex tasks and large-scale AI applications, making it a powerful alternative to traditional transformers. How do State Space Models improve the accuracy of AI models, such as RNNs or Transformers in processing temporal data? State Space Models improve AI accuracy by explicitly modeling the underlying state of a system over time, leading to better predictions and more interpretable results, especially in time-sensitive applications.

If you haven't enrolled in the program already, Don't wait! What is Machine Learning? Machine Learning is the science of teaching machines how to learn by themselves. Machine Learning is re-shaping and revolutionizing the world and disrupting industries and job functions globally. Machine learning is so extensive that you probably use it numerous times a day without even knowing it. From unlocking your mobile phones using your face to giving your attendance using a biometric machine, machine learning is being used in almost every stage. In this age of machine learning, every aspiring data scientist is expected to upskill themselves in machine learning techniques & tools and apply them in real-world business problems. What are the applications of Machine Learning? Now that you get the hang of it, you might be asking what are some of the examples of machine learning and how does it affect our life? Here are a few examples where we use the outcome of machine learning already: Smartphones detecting faces while taking photos or unlocking themselves Facebook, LinkedIn or any other social media site recommending your friends and ads you might be interested in Amazon recommending you the products based on your browsing history Banks using Machine Learning to detect Fraud transactions in real-time What kind of problems can be solved using Machine Learning? Machine Learning problems can be divided into 3 broad classes: Supervised Machine Learning Unsupervised Machine Learning Reinforcement Learning Here is an illustration of these different machine learning problems: Supervised Machine Learning: When you have past data with outcomes (labels in machine learning terminology) and you want to predict the outcomes for the future – you would use Supervised Machine Learning algorithms. Supervised Machine Learning problems can again be divided into 2 kinds of problems: Classification Problems: When you want to classify outcomes into different classes. For example – whether a customer would default on their loan or not is a classification problem which is of high interest to any Bank Regression Problem: When you are interested in answering how much – these problems would fall under the Regression umbrella. For example – what is the expected amount of default from a customer is a Regression problem Unsupervised Machine Learning: There are times when you don’t want to exactly predict an Outcome. You just want to perform a segmentation or clustering. For example – a bank would want to have a segmentation of its customers to understand their behavior. This is an Unsupervised Machine Learning problem as we are not predicting any outcomes here. Reinforcement Learning: It is said to be the hope of true artificial intelligence. And it is rightly said so because the potential that Reinforcement Learning possesses is immense. It is a slightly complex topic as compared to traditional machine learning but an equally crucial one for the future. What will I learn from this course?

What are the different types of evaluation metrics? How do you gauge and improve your machine learning model? This course will teach you all about evaluation metrics for machine learning models! Enroll for free Evaluation Metrics are a Key Part of Machine Learning Models Evaluation metrics form the backbone of improving your machine learning model. Without these evaluation metrics, we would be lost in a sea of machine learning model scores - unable to understand which model is performing well. Wondering where evaluation metrics fit in? Here’s how the typical machine learning model building process works: We build a machine learning model (both regression and classification included) Get feedback from the evaluation metric(s) Make improvements to the model Use the evaluation metric to gauge the model’s performance, and Continue until you achieve a desirable accuracy Evaluation metrics, essentially, explain the performance of a machine learning model. An important aspect of evaluation metrics is their capability to discriminate among model results. If you’ve ever wondered how concepts like AUC-ROC, F1 Score, Gini Index, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Confusion Matrix work, well - you’ve come to the right course! As a Machine Learning and Data Science aspirant, you need to be able to answer these questions about evaluation metrics: What is an evaluation metric? What are the different types of evaluation metrics? Do I really need to master evaluation metrics to understand machine learning? What kind of evaluation metrics questions can I expect in an interview? How do evaluation metrics help me improve my hackathon rankings? Can I use the same evaluation metrics for regression as well as classification problems? Is cross validation an evaluation metric? You will learn all about evaluation metrics for machine learning models in this course. We will discuss the different types of evaluation metrics, including how to use them for evaluating classification and regression models. Enroll for free When to use Evaluation Metrics in Machine Learning? We have seen plenty of analysts and aspiring data scientists not even bothering to check how robust their machine learning model is. Once they are finished building a model, they hurriedly map predicted values on unseen data. This is an incorrect approach. Simply building a machine learning model is not the motive! It’s about creating and selecting a model which gives high accuracy on an out of sample data (or unseen data). Hence, it is crucial to check the accuracy of your model prior to computing predicted values. This is where evaluation metrics help us. Course curriculum 1 Introduction Types of Machine Learning Why do we need Evaluation Metrics? AI&ML Blackbelt Plus Program (Sponsored) 2 Evaluation Metrics: Classification Confusion Matrix Quiz: Confusion Matrix Accuracy Quiz: Accuracy Alternatives of Accuracy Quiz: Alternatives of Accuracy Precision and Recall Quiz: Precision and Recall F-Score Thresholding AUC-ROC Quiz: AUC-ROC Log Loss Quiz: Log Loss Gini Coefficient 3 Evaluation Metrics: Regression MAE and MSE RMSE and RMSLE Quiz: RMSE and RMSLE R2 and Adjusted R2 R2 and Adjusted R2 4 What Next? Cross-Validation The Way Forward Common Questions Beginners Ask About Evaluation Metrics What is an evaluation metric? The answer lies in the name itself! Evaluation metrics help us evaluate, or gauge, the performance (or accuracy) of our machine learning model. They are an integral part of the machine learning model building pipeline as we can iterate and improve our model’s performance by judging how it’s working. What are the different types of evaluation metrics? There are several types of evaluation metrics for machine learning models. The choice of the evaluation metric completely depends on the type of model and the implementation plan of the model. The evaluation metrics varies according to the problem types - whether you’re building a regression model (continuous target variable) or a classification model (discrete target variable). In this course, we’re covering evaluation metrics for both machine learning models. Here’s a taste of the different evaluation metrics you’ll find in the course: Confusion Matrix (Classification evaluation metric) F1 Score (Classification evaluation metric) AUC-ROC (Classification evaluation metric) Gini Coefficient (Classification evaluation metric) Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE - Regression evaluation metric), and many more! Do I really need to master evaluation metrics to understand machine learning? The short answer - yes. Evaluation metrics are critical to judging and improving our machine learning model’s performance. And who doesn’t want to do that? Evaluation metrics are a must-know concept for every machine learning and data science aspirant. What kind of evaluation metrics questions can I expect in an interview? Here are a few common questions we’ve seen asked of beginners about evaluation metrics: What are the different types of evaluation metrics for regression and classification problems? Given a particular classification problem, should you use AUC-ROC or F1 Score (or something else)? What is precision and recall? How does that help in evaluating your machine learning model? What should you do if an evaluation metric is not working according to what you expected? You’ll get a better idea about how to answer these questions inside the course. How do evaluation metrics help me improve my hackathon rankings? Evaluation metrics, as you might have guessed by now, will be of supreme importance in machine learning hackathons. Your ranking on the hackathon leaderboard will be based on the evaluation metric being used in that hackathon. There’s no getting away from it - evaluation metrics are the lifeblood of your machine learning model’s performance. Can I use the same evaluation metrics for regression as well as classification problems? Not quite. Regression and classification models have their separate evaluation metrics. Remember , the evaluation metric depends on the target variable. If your target variable is continuous (aka a regression problem), you can’t use a classification metric to evaluate it! Is cross validation an evaluation metric? Cross validation is not technically an evaluation metric but we’ve still included this in the course. Cross Validation is one of the most important concepts in any type of machine learning model and a data scientist should be well versed in how it works.

K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm is a distance based supervised learning algorithm that is used for solving classification problems. In this, we will be looking at the classes of the k nearest neighbors to a new point and assign it the class to which the majority of k neighbours belong too. To identify the nearest neighbors we use various techniques of measuring distance, the most common of them being the  ‘Euclidean Distance’. Why should you learn KNN in machine learning? KNN is among the most widely used and popular machine learning algorithms in the industry. Every data scientist, amateur or established, is expected to know the ins and outs of KNN. You should be able to implement it in Python or R (or any other programming language) if you want to land a role in the machine learning space. Additionally, as you’ll see in the course, KNN unlocks a lot of avenues to solving machine learning problems. When should you use KNN? KNN can be used for both classification and regression predictive problems. However, it is more widely used in classification problems in the industry. Can I use KNN for both classification and regression problems? Yes! We just answered the question above but let’s expand a bit more on that. To evaluate any technique we generally look at 3 important aspects: Ease to interpret output Calculation time Predictive Power Let us take a few examples to place KNN on the machine learning scale: KNN algorithm fairs well across all parameters of considerations. It is commonly used for its ease of interpretation and low calculation time. What kind of projects can you do using KNN? You can perform both classification and regression projects. From predicting the price of a house (regression) to identifying if a loan will default or not (classification), you can apply KNN across a range of problems. We suggest heading to the DataHack platform, picking up a problem of your choice, and applying KNN there to solidify your practical understanding. Do I need to learn Python or R (or any other programming language) to use KNN? Well - yes and no. While KNN can still be performed on GUI based tools like KNIME, you should still have a working knowledge of how to implement it in Python or R. That’s a key consideration in the machine learning space. Will machine learning project interviews ask you about KNN? There’s a high chance you’ll be asked at least a couple of questions on the KNN algorithm. Depending on the level you’re applying for, you could be asked to explain how KNN works in a certain business scenario and how you would explain the results of a KNN model to a non-technical audience (a very common question!). What does the ”K” in KNN stand for? “K” in “KNN” stands for the number of cases that are considered to be ""nearest"" when you convert the cases as points in a euclidean space. That means, if we consider k=3, and when a new point has to be assigned a class, it will be on the basis of the classes of the 3 nearest points that surround the new point as per the euclidean distance. How to calculate the distance between points in KNN? There are various methods for calculating this distance, of which the most commonly known methods are – Euclidian, Manhattan (for continuous) and Hamming distance (for categorical). While other methods do exist, these are typically the most common ones and you’ll learn more about them in the course.

Enroll for free A Comprehensive Course on Ensemble Learning Ensemble learning is a powerful machine learning algorithm that is used across industries by data science experts. The beauty of ensemble learning techniques is that they combine the predictions of multiple machine learning models. You must have used or come across several of these ensemble learning techniques in your machine learning journey: - Bagging - Boosting - Stacking - Blending, etc. These ensemble learning techniques include popular machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, among others. You must be getting a good idea of how vast and useful ensemble learning can be! As a newcomer to Ensemble Learning in Machine Learning, you would need to know the below questions: - What is Ensemble Learning? - Why should you learn Ensemble Learning? - What are the different types of Ensemble Learning techniques? - Can you use Ensemble Learning for both Regression and Classification problems? - What are the most popular Ensemble Learning techniques? - What’s the intuition behind Bagging in Ensemble Learning? - Similarly, what’s the idea behind Boosting in Ensemble Learning? - What’s the difference between Bagging and Boosting? - Do these Ensemble Learning techniques improve our machine learning model? - Will learning Ensemble Learning help me crack machine learning interviews and win hackathons? This course by Analytics Vidhya will introduce you to the concept of ensemble learning and understand the machine learning algorithms that use Ensemble Learning.

What do you need to get started with the Ensemble Learning and Ensemble Learning Techniques course? A working laptop/desktop with 4 GB RAM A working Internet connection Basic knowledge of Machine Learning Basic knowledge of Python / R - check out this Course first, if you are new to Python Common Questions Beginners Ask About Ensemble Learning What is Ensemble Learning? Just like you come to a decision to buy a car by reading multiple reviews and opinions, in machine learning also, you can combine the decisions from multiple models to improve the overall performance. This technique of combining multiple machine learning models is called ensemble learning. Why do we need to know about Ensemble Learning? Ensemble learning is one of the most effective ways to build an efficient machine learning model. You can build an ensemble machine learning model using simple models and yet get great scores which are at par with the resource-hungry models like neural networks. What are the different types of Ensemble Learning techniques? There are simple and advanced ensemble learning techniques. Simple: Max Voting Averaging Weighted Averaging Advanced Stacking Blending Bagging Boosting In bagging and Boosting, there are other popular models like Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc. We will be covering all these techniques comprehensively and with Python code in this course. Do we use Ensemble Learning techniques only for classification or regression or both? We can use ensemble learning for both types of machine learning problems: Classification and Regression. While techniques like Max Voting are used for classification, techniques like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc can be used for both Classification and Regression problems. What are the more popular ensemble learning techniques? Ensemble learning techniques like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and variants, XGBoost, and LightGBM are extremely popular in hackathons. Depending on the data we are dealing with, we can use these techniques as our machine learning models. For example, you can use LightGBM(Light Gradient Boosting) for large datasets, or CatBoost for when your data has categorical variables. What is the intuition behind Bagging? The idea behind bagging is combining the results of multiple models (for instance, all decision trees) to get a generalized result. Bagging (or Bootstrap Aggregating) technique uses subsets (bags) to get a fair idea of the distribution (complete set). What is the intuition behind Boosting? Boosting is a sequential process, where each subsequent model attempts to correct the errors of the previous model on subsets of the data. The succeeding models are dependent on the previous model. The boosting algorithm combines a number of weak learners to form a strong learner and boost your overall results. What is the difference between Bagging and Boosting? While both bagging and boosting involve creating subsets, bagging makes these subsets randomly, while boosting prioritizes misclassified subsets. Additionally, at the final step in bagging, the weighted average is used, while boosting uses majority weighted voting. Does ensemble learning improve my machine learning model? In a word, yes! And that too drastically! Ensemble learn can improve the results of your machine learning even exponentially at times. There are two major benefits of Ensemble models: More accurate predictions(closer to the actual value) Combining multiple simple models to make a strong model improves the stability of the overall machine learning model. As you will learn in the course, we will take a real-life dataset and study how ensemble learning improves the score of our machine learning model as compared to using only simple models. Would knowing about ensemble learning help me crack interviews and hackathons? Ensemble learning is the go-to method to achieve a high rank on hackathon leaderboards. You can go over the winning approaches of multiple hackathons, and there is a guarantee that a majority would have used an ensemble technique as their machine learning model. Not only in hackathons but ensemble models are also used extremely popular in the industry because of how cost-effective they are. That is why, questions on random forest, gradient boosting, stacking, etc are often asked in interviews. Proposing an ensemble learning solution for a problem statement in an interview would always give you an edge over other solutions!

Common Questions Beginners Ask About Naive Bayes What is Naive Bayes? In machine learning, the Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm based on the concept of Bayes Theorem. Bayes theorem is one of the fundamental theorems in probability. We will be learning all these concepts in the course quite thoroughly How are Naive Bayes and probability related? The Bayes Theorem forms the backbone of the Naive Bayes algorithm. We use conditional probability to classify the data - thus, the Naive Bayes algorithm basically gives us the probability of a record being in a particular class, given the values of the features. This is nothing but conditional probability! What are the assumptions we need to keep in mind for using the Naive Bayes algorithm? The most important assumption that Naive Bayes makes is that all the features are independent of each other. You might also need to convert the continuous variables into discrete variables. What are the different types of Naive Bayes algorithms? There are 3 main types of Naive Bayes algorithms: Gaussian Naive Bayes Multinomial Naive Bayes Bernoulli Naive Bayes We will be covering all these techniques comprehensively and with Python code in this course. Can Naive Bayes be used only for binary classification? Not at all - in fact, the Naive Bayes classifier is one of the most popular algorithms for multiclass classification. Depending on the data we are dealing with, we can use any of the 3 types of the Naive Bayes algorithms How does Naive Bayes hold up against other classification algorithms? Though classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, random forest, etc are quite popular, Naive Bayes holds its own among them. It is faster than Random forest, since it can adapt to changing data pretty quickly. If the assumptions of Naive Bayes hold true, then it is much faster than logistic regression as well. What are the main advantages of Naive Bayes? The main advantages are: It is fast, and easy to understand It is not prone to overfitting It does not need much training data What are the main advantages of Naive Bayes? Like all other algorithms, Naive Bayes has its own set of cons as well: It does not work that well when the number of features is very high The assumption that input features are independent of each other may not always hold true You might lose important information while discretising the continuous variables. What are the applications of the Naive Bayes algorithm? Though the algorithm is relatively simple to understand, you cannot underestimate the power of the Naive Bayes classifier! It is fast, intuitive, and is used for text classification tasks. Since it can be used for multiclass classification as well, it is considered a very versatile and flexible classifier. A majority of research papers on text classification start off by using the Naive Bayes classifier as the baseline model. FAQs Who should take the Naive Bayes course? We have designed this course in a way that’s easy to understand for beginners in machine learning. You will get to learn Naive Bayes from scratch and also implement it using Python and R. Take this course if you want to learn a popular machine learning algorithm and expand your repertoire of techniques to solve classification problems.
