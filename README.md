# RAG-Based Smart Search System for Analytics Vidhya Courses

This project is a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** based smart search system designed to assist users in finding and querying information related to the free courses available on **Analytics Vidhya**. The system provides relevant course recommendations and answers user queries based on natural language inputs.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features
- **AI-Powered Search**: Utilizes a combination of semantic search and generative AI to deliver precise results.
- **LLAMA 3.3 70B by Groq**: The system uses the powerful **Llama 3.3 70B model** provided by **Groq** for natural language understanding and response generation.
- **Course Content Scraper**: Automated web scraping to collect course content and metadata.
- **RAG Implementation**: Combines traditional information retrieval with a language model to improve search relevance.
- **Vector Search with Pinecone**: Efficient vector storage and similarity search using **Pinecone**.
- **Streamlit Web App**: Interactive, user-friendly interface built with **Streamlit**.

## ðŸ“Š Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **BeautifulSoup4 & Requests**: Web scraping
- **Streamlit**: Web app framework
- **Llama 3.3 70B by Groq**: Large language model
- **Pinecone**: Vector database for storing embeddings
- **LangChain**: For integrating RAG components

## ðŸ“ˆ Workflow
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Scraped course content from Analytics Vidhya using `BeautifulSoup4` and `requests`.
   - Stored all course links in a text file for batch processing.
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed redundant content (e.g., common descriptions across all courses).
   - Split the content into smaller chunks suitable for the model's context window.
3. **Embedding & Storage**:
   - Generated vector embeddings for the cleaned content using **Llama 3.3 70B**.
   - Stored vectors in **Pinecone** for efficient retrieval.
4. **RAG Implementation**:
   - Used a retrieval-augmented generation approach where relevant course sections are retrieved and passed to the model for generating answers.
5. **Streamlit Web App**:
   - Developed a visually appealing **Streamlit** app to allow users to search and get course recommendations.
